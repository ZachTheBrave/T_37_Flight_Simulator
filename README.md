## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The T-37 Flight Simulator is an interactive, multiplayer exhibit designed to replicate the experience of piloting a T-37 aircraft. Built using **X-Plane 12** and a custom plugin written in C++, the simulator allows two users to simultaneously control virtual flight while interacting with physical cockpit components such as:

- Flight sticks with BNO055 sensor-based additive control
- LED feedback via Arduino
- Buttkicker haptic feedback
- Mounted displays
- Real-time orb collection and scoring mechanics
